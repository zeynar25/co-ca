            <h2>How Are Points Calculated?</h2>
            <p>Co-Ca uses a simple point system to reward your efforts and encourage you to keep learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Worth <strong>5 points</strong> per correct answer. These questions test your ability to type out answers, making them the most challenging and rewarding.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Choice:</strong> Worth <strong>3 points</strong> per correct answer. Select the right option from a list of possible answers.</li>
                <li><strong>True or False:</strong> Worth <strong>2 points</strong> per correct answer. A quick and simple way to test your knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This point system ensures that more effortful tasks, like identification, are rewarded accordingly, while quick questions like True or False still help you accumulate points.</p>

        <section class="vision">
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
